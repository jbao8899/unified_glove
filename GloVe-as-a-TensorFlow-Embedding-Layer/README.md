# [GloVe as a TensorFlow Embedding layer](https://github.com/guillaume-chevalier/GloVe-as-a-TensorFlow-Embedding-Layer)

In this tutorial, we'll see how to convert GloVe embeddings to TensorFlow layers. This could also work with embeddings generated from word2vec.

First, we'll download the embedding we need. 

Second, we'll load it into TensorFlow to convert input words with the embedding to word features. The conversion is done within TensorFlow, so it is GPU-optimized and it could run on batches on the GPU. It is also possible to run this tutorial with just a CPU. We'll play with word representations once the embedding is loaded. 

What you'll need: 
- A working installation of TensorFlow.
- 4 to 6 GB of disk space to download embeddings.

## First, some theory

### Representations

We need a way to represent content in neural networks. For audio, it's possible to use a [spectrogram](https://github.com/guillaume-chevalier/filtering-stft-and-laplace-transform). For images, it's possible to directly use the pixels and then get features maps from a convolutional neural network. For text, analyzing every letter is costly, so it's better to use word representations to embed words or documents as vectors into Artificial Neural Networks and other Machine Learning algorithms. 
> ![Features from content](https://www.tensorflow.org/images/audio-image-text.png)
> https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/word2vec

As described by Keras, an embedding:

> "Turns positive integers (indexes) into dense vectors of fixed size".

That's it. It's to extract features from words. An embedding is a huge matrix for which each row is a word, and each column is a feature from that word. To summarize, it's possible to convert a word to a vector of a certain length, such as 25, or 100, 200, 1000, and on. In practice, a length of 100 to 300 features is acceptable. With less than 100, we would risk underfitting our linguistic dataset. Word embeddings can eat a lot of RAM, so in this tutorial we'll download and use dimensions of size 25, however changing that to 200 would be a breeze with the actual code. 

### You can compute word analogies

The word representations (features) are linear, therefore it's possible to add and substract words with word embeddings. For example, here's the most known word analogy example:

<!--- $$\text{King} - \text{Man} = \text{Queen} - \text{Woman}$$ -->
<!--- $$\Longleftrightarrow$$ -->
<!--- $$\text{King} - \text{Man} + \text{Woman} = \text{Queen}$$ -->

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/guillaume-chevalier/GloVe-as-TensorFlow-Embedding/master/images/word_analogy.png" />
</p>

 For example, it's possible to change from: 
- Masculine and feminine
- Country and capital
- Singular and plural
- Verb tenses
- And the list goes on...

> ![Word features from embeddings](https://www.tensorflow.org/images/linear-relationships.png)
> https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/word2vec

It's also possible to compute the [Cosine Similarity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosine_similarity) between a word A and a word B, which is the cosine of the angle between the two words. A cosine similarity of -1 would mean the words are complete opposites, while a cosine similarity of 1 would mean that the words are the same. Here's the formula to compare two words: 

<!--- $$\text{Cosine Similarity}=cos({\theta}_{AB})=\frac{A \cdot B}{|A|_2 |B|_2}$$ -->

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/guillaume-chevalier/GloVe-as-TensorFlow-Embedding/master/images/cosine_similarity.png" />
</p>

Here, the norm (such as |A|â‚‚) is the **L2 norm**, the radius in space from the origin, but in a higher dimensional space such as with $n=300$: 

<!--- $$|A|_2=\sqrt{A_1 + A_2 + A_3 + ... + A_n}$$ -->

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/guillaume-chevalier/GloVe-as-TensorFlow-Embedding/master/images/L2_norm.png" />
</p>

### How does it looks like concretely?

For example, here are some cosine similarities to the word "king", computed from the code explained below: 

| Other Word | Cosine Similarity |
| ---------- | ----------------- |
| prince:    |   0.933741,       |
| queen:     |   0.9202421,      |
| aka:       |   0.91769224,     |
| lady:      |   0.9163239,      |
| jack:      |   0.91473544,     |
| 's:        |   0.90668976,     |
| stone:     |   0.8982374,      |
| mr.:       |   0.89194083,     |
| the:       |   0.88934386,     |
| star:      |   0.88920873,     |

Finally, notice how similar words are close in space: 
> ![](https://www.tensorflow.org/images/embedding-nearest-points.png)
> https://www.tensorflow.org/programmers_guide/embedding

Note: in the image above, the embedding have been subsampled to a lower 3D space with a PCA (Princial Component Analysis) or t-SNE (t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding) to be explorable. This is possible with TensorBoard for inspection. 300 dimensions can't be visualised easily. 

### But how are those word representations obtained?

Before continuing to the practical part where we'll use pretrained embeddings, it's a good thing to know that embeddings can be obtained from unsupervised training on large datasets of text. That's at least a way we can use the text off the internet! To perform this training to get an embedding, it's possible to go with the word2vec approach, or also with the GloVe (Global word Vectors). GloVe is a more recent approach that builds upon the theory of word2vec. Here, we'll use GloVe embeddings. To summarize how the unsupervised training happens, let's see what John Rupert Firth has to say: 

> You shall know a word by the company it keeps (Firth, J. R., 1957)

It's amazing that by comparing words and trying to guess the surrounding words, it's possible to find their meaning. To learn more on that, I'd recommend you the [5th course of the Deep Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/learn/nlp-sequence-models) on coursera by Andrew Ng, a course which can lead to the Deep Learning Specialization [certificate](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/specialization/U7VNC3ZD9YD8). 

## Let's get practical! 

### First, download the pretrained embeddings with the code below

Careful, the download will take 4-6 GB on disks. If you have already downloaded the embeddings, they will be located under the `./embeddings/` folder relative to here, and won't be downloaded again. 

Note: several embeddings were downloaded with different dimension sizes in the zip file, but we only need one.

### Let's read the embedding from disks here

First, we load the embeddings, then we demonstrate their usage. 


```python

def load_embedding_from_disks(glove_filename, with_indexes=True):
    """
    Read a GloVe txt file. If `with_indexes=True`, we return a tuple of two dictionnaries
    `(word_to_index_dict, index_to_embedding_array)`, otherwise we return only a direct 
    `word_to_embedding_dict` dictionnary mapping from a string to a numpy array.
    """
    if with_indexes:
        word_to_index_dict = dict()
        index_to_embedding_array = []
    else:
        word_to_embedding_dict = dict()

    
    with open(glove_filename, 'r') as glove_file:
        for (i, line) in enumerate(glove_file):
            
            split = line.split(' ')
            
            word = split[0]
            
            representation = split[1:]
            representation = np.array(
                [float(val) for val in representation]
            )
            
            if with_indexes:
                word_to_index_dict[word] = i
                index_to_embedding_array.append(representation)
            else:
                word_to_embedding_dict[word] = representation

    _WORD_NOT_FOUND = [0.0]* len(representation)  # Empty representation for unknown words.
    if with_indexes:
        _LAST_INDEX = i + 1
        word_to_index_dict = defaultdict(lambda: _LAST_INDEX, word_to_index_dict)
        index_to_embedding_array = np.array(index_to_embedding_array + [_WORD_NOT_FOUND])
        return word_to_index_dict, index_to_embedding_array
    else:
        word_to_embedding_dict = defaultdict(lambda: _WORD_NOT_FOUND)
        return word_to_embedding_dict

```


```python

print("Loading embedding from disks...")
word_to_index, index_to_embedding = load_embedding_from_disks(GLOVE_FILENAME, with_indexes=True)
print("Embedding loaded from disks.")

```

    Loading embedding from disks...
    Embedding loaded from disks.


### Unknown words have representations with values of zero, such as [0, 0, ..., 0]


```python
vocab_size, embedding_dim = index_to_embedding.shape
print("Embedding is of shape: {}".format(index_to_embedding.shape))
print("This means (number of words, number of dimensions per word)\n")
print("The first words are words that tend occur more often.")

print("Note: for unknown words, the representation is an empty vector,\n"
      "and the index is the last one. The dictionnary has a limit:")
print("    {} --> {} --> {}".format("A word", "Index in embedding", "Representation"))
word = "worsdfkljsdf"
idx = word_to_index[word]
embd = list(np.array(index_to_embedding[idx], dtype=int))  # "int" for compact print only.
print("    {} --> {} --> {}".format(word, idx, embd))
word = "the"
idx = word_to_index[word]
embd = list(index_to_embedding[idx])  # "int" for compact print only.
print("    {} --> {} --> {}".format(word, idx, embd))
```

    Embedding is of shape: (1193515, 25)
    This means (number of words, number of dimensions per word)
    
    The first words are words that tend occur more often.
    Note: for unknown words, the representation is an empty vector,
    and the index is the last one. The dictionnary has a limit:
        A word --> Index in embedding --> Representation
        worsdfkljsdf --> 1193514 --> [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
        the --> 13 --> [-0.010167, 0.020194, 0.21473, 0.17289, -0.43659, -0.14687, 1.8429, -0.15753, 0.18187, -0.31782, 0.06839, 0.51776, -6.3371, 0.48066, 0.13777, -0.48568, 0.39, -0.0019506, -0.10218, 0.21262, -0.86146, 0.17263, 0.18783, -0.8425, -0.31208]


### The L2 norm of some words can vary
Notice how more common words have a longer embedding norm, how some text on Twitter was in French, and how it deals with punctuation


```python
words = [
    "The", "Teh", "A", "It", "Its", "Bacon", "Star", "Clone", "Bonjour", "Intelligence", 
    "Ã€", "A", "Ã‡a", "Ca", "Ã‰tÃ©", "C'est", "Aujourd'hui", "Aujourd", "'", "hui", "?", "!", ",", ".", "-", "/", "~"
]

for word in words:
    word_ = word.lower()
    embedding = index_to_embedding[word_to_index[word_]]
    norm = str(np.linalg.norm(embedding))
    print((word + ": ").ljust(15) + norm)
print("Note: here we printed words starting with capital letters, \n"
      "however to take their embeddings we need their lowercase version (str.lower())")
```

### Let's load the embedding in TensorFlow

We simply create a non-trainable (frozen) tf.Variable() which we set to hold the value of the big embedding matrix.

First, let's define the variables and graph:


```python
batch_size = None  # Any size is accepted

tf.reset_default_graph()
sess = tf.InteractiveSession()  # sess = tf.Session()

# Define the variable that will hold the embedding:
tf_embedding = tf.Variable(
    tf.constant(0.0, shape=index_to_embedding.shape),
    trainable=False,
    name="Embedding"
)

tf_word_ids = tf.placeholder(tf.int32, shape=[batch_size])

tf_word_representation_layer = tf.nn.embedding_lookup(
    params=tf_embedding,
    ids=tf_word_ids
)
```

Sending the embedding to TensorFlow below. It will be located in the GPU from now (or on CPU if GPU is unavailable):


```python
tf_embedding_placeholder = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, shape=index_to_embedding.shape)
tf_embedding_init = tf_embedding.assign(tf_embedding_placeholder)
_ = sess.run(
    tf_embedding_init, 
    feed_dict={
        tf_embedding_placeholder: index_to_embedding
    }
)

print("Embedding now stored in TensorFlow. Can delete numpy array to clear some CPU RAM.")
del index_to_embedding

```

    Embedding now stored in TensorFlow. Can delete numpy array to clear some CPU RAM.


Now we can use or fetch representations, for example:


```python
batch_of_words = ["Hello", "World", "!"]
batch_indexes = [word_to_index[w.lower()] for w in batch_of_words]

embedding_from_batch_lookup = sess.run(
    tf_word_representation_layer, 
    feed_dict={
        tf_word_ids: batch_indexes
    }
)
print("Representations for {}:".format(batch_of_words))
print(embedding_from_batch_lookup)
```

    Representations for ['Hello', 'World', '!']:

### To avoid loading the embedding twice in RAM, make TensorFlow able to load them from disks directly


```python

## Build a model to get word similarities from word A to a list of many words B

This is for demo purposes. With a GPU, we can fetch many words quickly and compute on them. 

### Restarting from scratch: resetting the Jupyter notebook and loading embeddings from disks, the good way

Now that we have a TensorFlow checkpoint, let's load the embedding without having to parse the txt file into NumPy in CPU:

%reset

## Getting the top k most similars words to a word with the embedding matrix

Let's take an input word and compare it to every other words in the embedding matrix to return the most similar words. 


```python
tf.reset_default_graph()


# Transpose word_to_index dict:
index_to_word = dict((val, key) for key, val in word_to_index.items())


# New graph
tf.reset_default_graph()
sess = tf.InteractiveSession()

# Load the embedding matrix in tf
tf_word_to_index = load_word_to_index(
    DICT_WORD_TO_INDEX_FILE_NAME)
tf_embedding = load_embedding_tf(
    tf_word_to_index,
    TF_EMBEDDINGS_FILE_PATH, 
    word_representations_dimensions)

# An input word 
tf_word_id = tf.placeholder(tf.int32, shape=[1])
tf_word_representation = tf.nn.embedding_lookup(
    params=tf_embedding, ids=tf_word_id)

# An input 
tf_nb_similar_words_to_get = tf.placeholder(tf.int32)

# Dot the word to every embedding
tf_all_cosine_similarities = cosine_similarity_tensorflow(
    tf_word_representation, 
    tf_embedding)

# Getting the top cosine similarities. 
tf_top_cosine_similarities, tf_top_word_indices = tf.nn.top_k(
    tf_all_cosine_similarities,
    k=tf_nb_similar_words_to_get+1,
    sorted=True
)

# Discard the first word because it's the input word itself:
tf_top_cosine_similarities = tf_top_cosine_similarities[1:]
tf_top_word_indices = tf_top_word_indices[1:]

# Get the top words' representations by fetching 
# tf_top_words_representation = "tf_embedding[tf_top_word_indices]":
tf_top_words_representation = tf.gather(
    tf_embedding,
    tf_top_word_indices)

    star:           0.88920873,     4.3772125


Notice the bad quality of the similar words, embeddings with more dimensions than 25 would make it better. 

Reminder: we chose 25 dimensions for tutorial purposes not to eat all our RAM. There are better embeddings out there.

##  What's next?

I think getting the embeddings into TensorFlow is a good step into building a language model. You may want to grab some data, such as [here](https://github.com/awesomedata/awesome-public-datasets#naturallanguage) and [here](https://github.com/niderhoff/nlp-datasets). You may also want to learn more about how recurrent neural networks can read features such as sentences or signal of varying length, such as [an LSTM (RNN) encoder reading signal](https://github.com/guillaume-chevalier/LSTM-Human-Activity-Recognition) or an [signal predictor from a seq2seq GRU (RNN)](https://github.com/guillaume-chevalier/seq2seq-signal-prediction) which could be used in practice to [predict next words in a sentence](https://blog.openai.com/unsupervised-sentiment-neuron/). Since signal is closely related to sentences with embedded words, RNNs can be applied on both.
